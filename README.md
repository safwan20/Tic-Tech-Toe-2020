### Problem Statement
Nowadays, all the things are going online. Major concern of everything going online is safety, especially women safety. There are many issues people face on online platforms like trolling, teasing, etc. Can you come up with anything which can assure safety on such platforms. It need not necessarily be mobile or web interface but anything implemented by yourself.
